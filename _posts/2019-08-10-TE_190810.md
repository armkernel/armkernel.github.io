### Today English

- My dad got me a badminton racquet for my 15th birthday gift. I was very excited. My dad taught me how to play badminton. I still enjoy playing badminton. I have been playing it for over 10 years.

- My family was eating at a restaurant. I found a hair in my food. I am gross. I complained and then they baught a new dish. I didn't pay for it.
=> it was gross.. do not use "I" expressing your emotion in sentence.. I (x)
