### 오늘 한 일
- [TE](https://armkernel.github.io/TE_190815/) 2 문장을 외우고 복습했다.
  - I don't like to wear a seatbelt in a car because it feels restricted. However, I always wear a seatbelt when i drive on a high way. I feel like I have to wear it regardless of my seating position.

  - I got a bike for my 18th birthday present. It was my first bike and I liked it a lot. One day, I parked my bike near the subway station and someone stole it. I cried for a week.
