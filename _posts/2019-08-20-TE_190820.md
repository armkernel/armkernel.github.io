- I left the office at midnight. However, It was Friday. So there were so many people on the street and everyone was trying to get cabs. It took me 40 minuates to get a cab.

- My dad got me a badminton racquet for my 15th birthday gift. It was very excited. My dad taught me how to play badminton. I still enjoy playing badminton. I have been playing it for over 10 years.
