### Feedback
- I wanted to learn Chinese. So I looked online and found a chinese language academy near Gangnam station. I signed up for a class by paying my credit card.

- I left the office at midnight. It was Friday. So there were so many people on the street and everyone was trying to get cabs. It took me 40 minuates to get a cab.

- My friend lee is a heavy smoker. So whenever we go to a coffee shop, she always makes sure it has a smoking area inside. She never goes to one without one.

- After my dad retired, he wanted to help my mom with the housework. My dad tried to cook but it was bad that we couldn't eat it at all. My mom told him to do the dishes instead. When my mom cooks, my dad does the dishes afterwards.
