### Today English
- I usually take a walk at the park on the weekends. It refreshes my mind and body. I love having a cup of coffee after dinner at the park. I think it is my favorite time of the day.

- It was supposed to be sunny today. However, it rained in the middle of the day and I got wet. It is frustrating when the weather forecast is wrong.  I will have to carry around an umbrella in my bag all the time.

- I sing to release my stress. Last night, I went to singing area with my friends. One of my frineds started to sing and he wouldn't stop. it was not enjoyable. I am never going to sing with him again
