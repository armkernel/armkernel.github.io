### Today English
- I hate getting on a packed bus during rush hours. So I decided to ride a bike to work. So I got a new bike and a helmat and was so ready for it. However, the bike lanes were not built so well. So I gave up on riding it to work.

### feedback.

- I got a new bike for my 18th birthday present. It was my first bike and liked it a lot. One day, I parked my bike near the subway station and someone stole it. I cried for a week.
