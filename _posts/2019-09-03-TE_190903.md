### Today English
- I was sitting on the bus. An old lady got on and stood next to the person in front of me. I thought he would stand up but he didn't. I felt bad and gave up my seat to the old lady.

### Feedback.
- I thought there still was the last bus so i waited for it for more than half an hour. It turned out that the last bus had left 5 minuates before i came.

- I was waiting in lines to get on the subway. Me and other people were waiting behind the white line on the platform. When the train arrived, a man rushed and tried to get on the train before the passenger on the train got off. He was so rude.

- There is bus station in front of my house. The subway station is just a few blocks away from my house. It is convenient public transportation. I always travel by public transportation.
