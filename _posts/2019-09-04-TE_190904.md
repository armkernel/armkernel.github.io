### Today English
- I used to use Polaroid camera a lot but it was such a bummer to buy instant film. Now I can take pictures with my cell phone and print them out. It is very convenient.

### Feedback.
- I always retouch my pictures with Photoshop before I post them on Facebook. The pictures look much better wiht Photoshop. I think Photoshop is the greatest thing ever.

- I was waiting on the bus. An old lady got on and stood next to the person in front of me. I thought he would stand up but he didn't. I felt bad and gave up my seat to the old lady.

- I thought there still was the last bus so i waited for it for more than half an hour. It turned out the last bus had left 5 minuates before i came.

- I was waiting in lines to get on the subway. Me and other people were waiting behine the white line on the plarform. When the train arrived, a men rushed and tried to get on the subway before the passenger on the train got off. He was so rude.
