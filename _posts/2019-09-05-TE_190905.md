### Today English
- When I order my food, the staff repeats it into the microphone so that the kitchen staff can hear the order. I remember when i was young, it was interesting to see and i wanted to try it.

### Feedback.
- When I go to Macdonal's, I always order a combo meal. When i get cheese burger only, it costs 3,500 won. However, If i order a combo meal, it costs 5,000 won for a cheese burger, a coke and French fries.

- When I went to visit my friend, I first took the subway line 2 but i had to transfer to line 3. I went to the transfer station which was about 5 stops away and transfered to subway line 3. It was easy.

- I took the driver's license test for both automatic and stick shift cars. I know how to drive both of them. However, my first car was an automatic car and I hardly got to drive stick shift car. Automatic cars are much easier to drive.
