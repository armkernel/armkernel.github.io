### feedback
- My friend and I were planing to have dinner together. But we couldn't make any plans because it was hard to set a time that works for both of us. I think she too busy.

- I don't like eating alone. When I have no one to eat with, I just skip it and have some bread instead. When I was taking classes by myself, I lost 5 kg in one semester.

- I was at lunch and one of the people at my table was eating with his mouth open. His noisy eating bothered me. Furthermore while he was talking, some food spattered onto mine. I couldn't eat anymore.
