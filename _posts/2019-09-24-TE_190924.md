### Today English
- The first time I went to a public bath. I left my locker key somewhere and I had to wait for the owner to find the spare key to my locker. Since then, I always wear a locker key around my wrist while bathing.

### Feedback.
- I like scrubbing my body at a public bath. I went to the public bath yesterday. I first went into a hot tub and sat for 30 minuates and then started scrubbing. After scrubbing for 20 minates, I felt I had lost 1 kg.
