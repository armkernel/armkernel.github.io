### Today English
- A couple of weeks ago, I went to a singing room in my neighborhood. The soundproof facilities at the singing room were not good. I could hear everything from the next room. It was bothersome.

### Feedback.

- I sing to release stress. Last night, I went to a singing room with my friends. One of my friends started to sing and he wouldn't stop. It was not enjoyable. I am never going to sing with him again.
