- I thought there still was the last bus so i waited for it for more than half an hour. I turned out that the last bus had left 5 minuates ago before i came here.

- I was sitting on the bus. An old lady got on and stood next to the person in front of me. I thought he would stand but he didn't. I felt bad and gave up my seat to the old lady. 

- I always retouch my pictures with Photoshop before i post them on Facebook. The pictures look much better with Photoshop. I think Photoshop is the greatest thing ever.

- I used to use Polaroid camera a lot but it was such a bummer to buy instant film. Now I can take pictures with my cell phone and print them out. It is very convenient.

- I like going to the bookstore. It is fun looking around the bookstore. When I have time, I just go there and pick up some books even though there is nothing in particular i want to buy.

- The book i was looking for was not in stock at the bookstore i went to. So i called another bookstore to see if they have a copy. They did. So I went there and got it.

- I was waiting in lines to get on the subway. Me and other people were waiting behind the white line on the platform. When the subway arrived, a man rushed and tried to get on the train before the passengers on the train got off. He was so rude.

- I went to visit my friend. I first took the subway line 2 and I had to transfer to line 3. I went to the transfered station which was about 5 stops away
