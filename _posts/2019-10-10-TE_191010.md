### Feedback.
- The movie was so sad that I cried my eyes out. My friend said I embarrassed him. I can't believe he didn't cry. I think he is cold-hearted.

- I drank a lot and blacked out last night. I literally don't remember how i got home. I just hope that I didn't do anything stupid. I am going to quit drinking.

- I drink like a fish. When I drink, I drink at least 3 bottles of soju. Most of my friends all drink a lot. When three of us meet, we usually drink 10 bottles of soju between us. The funny thing is that we see each other almost every day.
