- I like playing video games when i was little. I am an only child so i used to play alone. When I was in elementary school, I made some friends. They came to my house to play games together.

- When I was five, my parents wanted to have a baby boy. They were hopful but it was girl again. I was excited to have a sister. My sister and I are best frineds now.

- My brother always was in his room playing computer games. He eats and sleeps in his room. So I barely see him in the house. He is totally addicted to computer games.

- Playing computer games help me to release stress. When I am overwhelmed by life and have too many things to think about, I just play computer games for a few minuates. It helps me forget things and I feel better after playing games.

- I went into a new roller coaster in the amusement park. It was so scary. It was the most hair rising roller coaster I've ever gone on. I felt sick and exausted after the ride.
