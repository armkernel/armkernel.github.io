### Today English
- When I tried to come out of the parking lot at mall, I didn't see the car passing behind me and almost hit it. Since then, I always park backwards. In that case, I won't be at risk of reversing into unkown traffic.

### Feedback.

- I don't like to wear a seatbelt in a car because it feels restricted. However, I always wear a seatbelt when I drive on a high way. I feel like I have to wear it regardless of my seating position.

- My boss called me this morning. He was in a minor accident on his way to work. I asked him if he was okay and he said he was fine. He also told me to prepare the meeting by myself.

- I took the driver's license test for both automatic and stick shift cars. I know how to drive both of them. However, my first car was an automatic and I hardly got to drive stick shift cars.
