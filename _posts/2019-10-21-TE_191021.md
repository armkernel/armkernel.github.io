### Today English
- I hate getting on a packed bus during rush hours. So I decided to ride a bike to work. I got a new bike and a helmat and was so ready for it. However, the bike lanes were not built so well, so I gave up on riding it to work.

### Feedback
- I got a new bike for my 18th birthday present. It was my first bike and I liked it a lot. One day, I parked my bike near the subway station, and someone stole it. I cried for a week.

- My dad got me a badminton raqec?
