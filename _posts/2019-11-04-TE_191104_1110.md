- I like going to the book store. It is fun looking around the book store. When I have time, I just go there and pick up some books even though there is nothing ,in particular, I want to buy.

- The book I was looking for was not in stock at the book store i went to. So I called another book store to see if they have a copy. They did. So I went there and got it.
